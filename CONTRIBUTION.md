# Contribution

Contributions are most welcome :

Just incase you need a reminder on how to get the code

- Perform a git clone

    ```sh
        git clone "https://github.com/Eshanatnight/Daletos"
    ```

- go in the directory

    ```sh
        cd .\Daletos
    ```

- Open in your Favourite Text Editor (u can also use cmake)

note : you require the <a href="https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt">fmt lib</a>
<p>If you are using Visual Studio I would suggest using the vcpkg package manager for using the fmt library
<a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg"> vcpkg </a> for easier installation</p>

## Installation of vcpkg

```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git
```

```sh
    cd vcpkg
```

```sh
    ./bootstrap-vcpkg.sh
```

```sh
    ./vcpkg integrate install
```

```sh
    vcpkg install fmt
```
